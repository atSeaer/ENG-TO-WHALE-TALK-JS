# ENG TO WHALE TALK

This is a translator from English to how would a Whale pronounce what we write.

Because whales only sppeak vowels a, e, i , o and u

We can create an array of those letters loops around userinput and return only those vowels

Because whales exaggerate few sounds, we will return E/U as doubled from the english text

Finally, all vowels collected will be joined togetther as 1 word and uppercased
